Approximately 8 percent of the population are color blind. Our goal is to create a web app that tests if a combination of colors is color-blind friendly or if they will present conflicting colors. You can enter your color palette via hex color codes to receive possible conflicting colors. You can also enter the link to any website, and our app will retrieve the 10 most common colors that appear on that website, and return any possible conflicting colors.
